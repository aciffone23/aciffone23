👋 Hey, I'm Angelo Ciffone

Ever since I birthed my brainchild "Canal" – a React/Rails lovechild – I've been on a coding joyride, leaving trails of semicolons and curly braces wherever I go.

🔍 Currently on the lookout for my next adventure in the tech realm! 🚀 I'm eager to join a close-knit team, sling some code, and potentially drop a game-changing feature or two. If you're in the business of hiring brilliant minds (or even just decent ones), let's have a virtual coffee and chat about how I can sprinkle some magic on your projects.

🎮 When not tangled in the web of code, you'll find me passionately cheering for my favorite football team(aka my fantasy team) or strategically losing in the latest gaming sensation. Because let's face it, losing builds character, right?

Let's turn bits and bytes into smiles and high-fives! 👾✨
